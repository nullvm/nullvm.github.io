      <description>&lt;p&gt;Minecraft is a sandbox game where you can craft things, mine caves, cook food
and basically any other stuff almost with no rules. There is no rules in the game
as in what the player is supposed to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course you can beat the Ender Dragon and get the credit but it&amp;rsquo;s not the end of
the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who enjoyed good story, character development, and world building in games
or books, I find it difficult to enjoy games like Minecraft since the game doesn&amp;rsquo;t
tell you what you need to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
