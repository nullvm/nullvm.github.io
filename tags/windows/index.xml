      <description>&lt;p&gt;As someone coming from linux, there is one thing that I miss when trying to
daily driving windows, and that is the terminal. Windows has great terminal
emulator nowadays, with powershell being windows&amp;rsquo; most powerful shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, it&amp;rsquo;s really natural for me to spend most of my time in the terminal
when I&amp;rsquo;m using linux, it&amp;rsquo;s just much more simple and more focused. Not only that,
the commands in linux are really short consisting of 2-6 letters on average, and
once you know your way, you can combine any of that commands to make everything
even more concise and quick.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since I installed my first Linux distro (good old Ubuntu), I never once thought about going back to Windows. I mean, why would I? Before Linux, I only touched computers for gaming. Anything beyond that—writing documents, checking emails, or wrestling with random &lt;strong&gt;Blue Screen of Death&lt;/strong&gt; encounters—sounded like the digital equivalent of watching paint dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux changed everything. Suddenly, computers weren’t these boring office machines—they were &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt;. They were obedient little metal pets that did whatever I told them to. Want to customize your entire desktop? Sure. Want to write a bash script that does absolutely nothing useful but makes you feel like a hacker? Go for it. Want to nuke your bootloader at 2 AM and spend the next 4 hours fixing it? Linux says, &lt;em&gt;“Challenge accepted.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
