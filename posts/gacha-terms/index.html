Graphics will keep evolving anyway — that’s just Moore’s Law with prettier shaders. But story? That’s pure human creativity, the real kernel that makes the whole program worth running.\nBut then one day, I stumbled onto this game called Zenless Zone Zero. The fandom wouldn’t stop posting memes about how it’s basically a gooner simulator. And yeah… they weren’t wrong. I tried it. I’m playing it. Don’t @ me.\nThe lore? Dark. Like “dmesg | grep depression” levels of dark. We’re talking loss, trauma, existential dread — basically the systemd-journald logs of human suffering. Naturally, I got hooked. And then I discovered something worse than the emotional rollercoaster: the game mechanics. Holy init scripts, there are so many moving parts. Mini-games, systems, currencies — it’s like Gentoo, but with waifus.\nSo, as a service to fellow lazy gamers and Linux nerds, here’s a quick glossary of common gacha terms. Think of it as a man page for the gacha-curious.\nWhat are Gacha Games? At their core, gacha games are games where the prizes are randomized. Imagine apt-get install random-waifu but it costs you your soul (and possibly your rent money). Gameplay can vary — some are RPGs, some are action-based, some just want you to click buttons like a bash script stuck in an infinite loop.\nBanner Think of this as the repo you pull from. It’s the place where the game says, “Hey, we’ve got shiny stuff right now, wanna roll the dice?”\nGacha Pulls The act of gambling with virtual dice. You “pull” on the banner, and the game spits out a prize. Most of the time it’s digital garbage. Occasionally, it’s something that makes your brain release enough dopamine to rival compiling a kernel with zero errors.\nFive-Star Item The golden goose, the sudo of the loot pool. If you get one, you feel invincible. Four-stars exist too, but they’re basically the Arch Linux wiki mirrors — nice to have, but you’ll forget them when the shiny one appears.\nPity System A mercy mechanic. It guarantees you’ll eventually get something good if luck isn’t on your side. Example: after enough failed pulls, the game says, “Fine, here’s your toy. Now stop crying.” It’s like fsck for your gambling addiction.\nMicrotransactions Tiny purchases that add up faster than your /var/log directory. “Just $0.99!” they say, but soon your bank account looks like a corrupted partition table.\nF2P Short for “Free to Play.” These are the noble monks of the gacha monastery, grinding daily missions without spending a cent. Basically, the Debian Stable users of the gacha world.\nWhale The opposite of F2P. Whales casually drop hundreds or thousands of dollars like it’s rm -rf /money. They keep the servers alive. Respect them, fear them, and pray you don’t end up becoming one.\nGear Equipment for your characters. It’s the ~/.config directory of your waifus. Without gear, your squad is just fancy-looking processes waiting to be killed by a segmentation fault.\nMeta The “Most Effective Tactic Available.” It’s whatever the community says is overpowered at the moment. Like switching from Vim to Neovim because “everyone does it.” You don’t have to follow the meta, but if you don’t, be ready to suffer.\nRerun When a banner comes back for round two. Missed your chance at that one character last year? Congrats, here’s your second chance to fail again.\nFinal Thoughts Gacha games are like package managers with a cruel sense of humor. You don’t always get what you want, but the cycle of pulling, grinding, and coping is strangely addicting. For programmers and Linux users, it’s basically debugging life: lots of frustration, occasional victories, and an endless log of questionable decisions.\nAt least in Linux, when you run make, you know it’ll eventually compile. In gacha, the compiler is randomness itself — and it has a tendency to segfault just when you need it most.\n",
